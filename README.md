The purpose of this project is to rank users according to their points. The users and their respective points are collected from a JSON file and the users are sorted based on their points.The users with the top three points have medals attached to their names. For example, the user with the highest point (Austin Okocha) has a gold medal attached to his name,which is to show that he is the highest ranking user. The design is such that the ranks, names, numbers, groups and points are visible from a distance.
